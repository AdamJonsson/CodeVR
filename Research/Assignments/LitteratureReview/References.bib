For male workers, job-related exercise has causal effects on weight, but for female workers, the effects seem primarily selective.

These effects are strongest for the heaviest quartile of men. Conversely, a male worker spending 18 years in the most strength-demanding occupation is about 28 pounds (15 percent) heavier than his counterpart in the least demanding job.},

Methods We searched the {PubMed}, Web of Knowledge, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases for observational studies related to the association of sedentary behaviour and depression risk up to 15 January 2014. Summary relative risks ({RRs}) were estimated by the use of a random effects model.
Results Thirteen cross-sectional studies with 110 152 participants and 11 longitudinal studies with 83 014 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The summary {RR} of depression for the highest versus nonoccasional/occasional sedentary behaviour was 1.25 (95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.35, I2=50.7\%) for all included studies. The pooled {RRs} of depression for sedentary behaviour were 1.31 (95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.48) in crosssectional studies and 1.14 (95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.21) in longitudinal studies. In subgroup analysis by different types of sedentary behaviour, the pooled {RRs} of depression were 1.13 (95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.21) for longtime {TV} viewing and 1.22 (95\% {CI} 1.10 to 1.34) for prolonged computer or internet use.

	abstract = {Background
Prolonged sitting time is a health risk. We describe a practice-based study designed to reduce prolonged sitting time and improve selected health factors among workers with sedentary jobs.

Community Context
We conducted our study during March–May 2011 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, among employees with sedentary jobs.

Methods
Project implementation occurred over 7 weeks with a baseline period of 1 week (period 1), an intervention period of 4 weeks (period 2), and a postintervention period of 2 weeks (period 3). The intervention group (n = 24) received a sit-stand device during period 2 designed to fit their workstation, and the comparison group (n = 10) did not. We used experience-sampling methods to monitor sitting behavior at work during the 7 weeks of the project. We estimated change scores in sitting time, health risk factors, mood states, and several office behaviors on the basis of survey responses.

Outcome
The Take-a-Stand Project reduced time spent sitting by 224\% (66 minutes per day), reduced upper back and neck pain by 54\%, and improved mood states. Furthermore, the removal of the device largely negated all observed improvements within 2 weeks.

Interpretation
Our findings suggest that using a sit-stand device at work can reduce sitting time and generate other health benefits for workers.},

The present study was the first systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of exercise-based {VR} and {AR} training as preventive measures in improving physical activity, psychological outcomes, and physical performance of a healthy population when compared with traditional programs and no-exercise controls. This study included 22 research articles published between 1997 and 2017, involving 1,184 participants aged 18 to 79. The results showed a large effect on physical activity (Hedges' g = 0.83, {SE} = 0.18), a small to moderate effect on physical performance (Hedges’ g = 0.31, {SE} = 0.09), and no significant effect on psychological outcomes. {VR} training programs were particularly shown to be effective for enhancing frequency of physical activity and strength of physical performance. Only two studies examined the effectiveness of {AR} training programs on physical performance, and the findings concerning those effects were not separately reported. A list of plausible moderators was tested but that variable was not significantly associated with the effects of {VR} on the three outcomes. Limitations and future directions are discussed.},

In this paper, we study text entry in {VR} by selecting characters on a virtual keyboard. We discuss the design space for assessing selection-based text entry in {VR}. Then, we implement six methods that span different parts of the design space and evaluate their performance and user preferences. Our results show that pointing using tracked hand-held controllers outperforms all other methods. Other methods such as head pointing can be viable alternatives depending on available resources. We summarize our findings by formulating guidelines for choosing optimal virtual keyboard text entry methods in {VR}.},

In this paradigm, programmers manipulate programming primitives through direct manipulation and get immediate feedback on their program's state and output. However, existing immersive authoring tools have a low ceiling; their programming primitives are intuitive but can only express a limited set of static relationships between elements in a scene. In this paper, we introduce {FlowMatic}, an immersive authoring tool that raises the ceiling of expressiveness by allowing programmers to specify reactive behaviors---behaviors that react to discrete events such as user actions, system timers, or collisions. {FlowMatic} also introduces primitives for programmatically creating and destroying new objects, for abstracting and re-using functionality, and for importing 3D models. Importantly, {FlowMatic} uses novel visual representations to allow these primitives to be represented directly in {VR}. We also describe the results of a user study that illustrates the usability advantages of {FlowMatic} relative to a 2D authoring tool and we demonstrate its expressiveness through several example applications that would be impossible to implement with existing immersive authoring tools. By combining a visual program representation with expressive programming primitives and a natural User Interface ({UI}) for authoring programs, {FlowMatic} shows how programmers can build fully interactive virtual experiences with immersive authoring.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, various technologies for visualizing three-dimensional (3D) scenes on displays have been technologically demonstrated and refined, among them such of stereoscopic, multi-view, integral imaging, volumetric, or holographic type. Most of the current approaches utilize the conventional stereoscopic principle. But they all lack of their inherent conflict between vergence and accommodation since scene depth cannot be physically realized but only feigned by displaying two views of different perspective on a flat screen and delivering them to the corresponding left and right eye. This mismatch requires the viewer to override the physiologically coupled oculomotor processes of vergence and eye focus that may cause visual discomfort and fatigue. This paper discusses the depth cues in the human visual perception for both image quality and visual comfort of direct-view 3D displays. We concentrate our analysis especially on near-range depth cues, compare visual performance and depth-range capabilities of stereoscopic and holographic displays, and evaluate potential depth limitations of 3D displays from a physiological point of view.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) displays have become important for many applications including vision research, operation of remote devices, medical imaging, surgical training, scientific visualization, virtual prototyping, and more. In many of these applications, it is important for the graphic image to create a faithful impression of the 3D structure of the portrayed object or scene. Unfortunately, 3D displays often yield distortions in perceived 3D structure compared with the percepts of the real scenes the displays depict. A likely cause of such distortions is the fact that computer displays present images on one surface. Thus, focus cues—accommodation and blur in the retinal image—specify the depth of the display rather than the depths in the depicted scene. Additionally, the uncoupling of vergence and accommodation required by 3D displays frequently reduces one's ability to fuse the binocular stimulus and causes discomfort and fatigue for the viewer. We have developed a novel 3D display that presents focus cues that are correct or nearly correct for the depicted scene. We used this display to evaluate the influence of focus cues on perceptual distortions, fusion failures, and fatigue. We show that when focus cues are correct or nearly correct, (1) the time required to identify a stereoscopic stimulus is reduced, (2) stereoacuity in a time-limited task is increased, (3) distortions in perceived depth are reduced, and (4) viewer fatigue and discomfort are reduced. We discuss the implications of this work for vision research and the design and use of displays.},

In this review, I discuss why this problem is pivotal for nearby tasks in {VR} and {AR}, present a comprehensive taxonomy of potential solutions, address advantages and shortfalls of each design, and cover various ways to better evaluate the solutions. The review describes how {VAC} is addressed in monocular, stereoscopic, and multiscopic {HMDs}, including retinal scanning and accommodation-free displays. Eye-tracking-based approaches that do not provide natural focal cues-gaze-guided blur and dynamic stereoscopy-are also covered. Promising future research directions in this area are identified.},

	abstract = {Recent increased usage of stereo displays has been accompanied by public concern about potential adverse effects associated with prolonged viewing of stereo imagery. There are numerous potential sources of adverse effects, but we focused on how vergence–accommodation conflicts in stereo displays affect visual discomfort and fatigue. In one experiment, we examined the effect of viewing distance on discomfort and fatigue. We found that conflicts of a given dioptric value were slightly less comfortable at far than at near distance. In a second experiment, we examined the effect of the sign of the vergence–accommodation conflict on discomfort and fatigue. We found that negative conflicts (stereo content behind the screen) are less comfortable at far distances and that positive conflicts (content in front of screen) are less comfortable at near distances. In a third experiment, we measured phoria and the zone of clear single binocular vision, which are clinical measurements commonly associated with correcting refractive error. Those measurements predicted susceptibility to discomfort in the first two experiments. We discuss the relevance of these findings for a wide variety of situations including the viewing of mobile devices, desktop displays, television, and cinema.},

	abstract = {Motion sickness can be caused by a variety of motion environments (e.g., cars, boats, planes, tilting trains, funfair rides, space, virtual reality) and given a sufficiently provocative motion stimulus almost anyone with a functioning vestibular system can be made motion sick. Current hypotheses of the ‘Why?’ of motion sickness are still under investigation, the two most important being ‘toxin detector’ and the ‘vestibular–cardiovascular reflex’. By contrast, the ‘How?’ of motion sickness is better understood in terms of mechanisms (e.g., ‘sensory conflict’ or similar) and stimulus properties (e.g., acceleration, frequency, duration, visual–vestibular time-lag). Factors governing motion sickness susceptibility may be divided broadly into two groups: (i) those related to the stimulus (motion type and provocative property of stimulus); and (ii) those related to the individual person (habituation or sensitisation, individual differences, protective behaviours, administration of anti-motion sickness drugs). The aim of this paper is to review some of the more important factors governing motion sickness susceptibility, with an emphasis on the personal rather than physical stimulus factors.},
