	abstract = {We use panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to investigate on-the-job exercise and weight. For male workers, job-related exercise has causal effects on weight, but for female workers, the effects seem primarily selective. A man who spends 18 years in the most physical fitness-demanding occupation is about 25 pounds (14 percent) lighter than his peer in the least demanding occupation. These effects are strongest for the heaviest quartile of men. Conversely, a male worker spending 18 years in the most strength-demanding occupation is about 28 pounds (15 percent) heavier than his counterpart in the least demanding job.},

	abstract = {Background Sedentary behaviour is associated with risk of depression. We review and quantitatively summarise the evidence from observational studies in a meta-analysis.
Methods We searched the {PubMed}, Web of Knowledge, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases for observational studies related to the association of sedentary behaviour and depression risk up to 15 January 2014. Summary relative risks ({RRs}) were estimated by the use of a random effects model.
Results Thirteen cross-sectional studies with 110 152 participants and 11 longitudinal studies with 83 014 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The summary {RR} of depression for the highest versus nonoccasional/occasional sedentary behaviour was 1.25 (95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.35, I2=50.7\%) for all included studies. The pooled {RRs} of depression for sedentary behaviour were 1.31 (95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.48) in crosssectional studies and 1.14 (95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.21) in longitudinal studies. In subgroup analysis by different types of sedentary behaviour, the pooled {RRs} of depression were 1.13 (95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.21) for longtime {TV} viewing and 1.22 (95\% {CI} 1.10 to 1.34) for prolonged computer or internet use.
Conclusions This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that sedentary behaviour is associated with increased risk of depression.},

	abstract = {Background
Prolonged sitting time is a health risk. We describe a practice-based study designed to reduce prolonged sitting time and improve selected health factors among workers with sedentary jobs.

Community Context
We conducted our study during March–May 2011 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, among employees with sedentary jobs.

Methods
Project implementation occurred over 7 weeks with a baseline period of 1 week (period 1), an intervention period of 4 weeks (period 2), and a postintervention period of 2 weeks (period 3). The intervention group (n = 24) received a sit-stand device during period 2 designed to fit their workstation, and the comparison group (n = 10) did not. We used experience-sampling methods to monitor sitting behavior at work during the 7 weeks of the project. We estimated change scores in sitting time, health risk factors, mood states, and several office behaviors on the basis of survey responses.

Outcome
The Take-a-Stand Project reduced time spent sitting by 224\% (66 minutes per day), reduced upper back and neck pain by 54\%, and improved mood states. Furthermore, the removal of the device largely negated all observed improvements within 2 weeks.

Interpretation
Our findings suggest that using a sit-stand device at work can reduce sitting time and generate other health benefits for workers.},
