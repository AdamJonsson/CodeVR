### Way to calculate energy expenditure
Good study explaining a number of ways to calculate EE
https://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/nh/v26n3/02_revision_02.pdf

Here is some notes from that paper.
* Direct calorimetry
  * Needs an isolated room that can detect the head differences while a person is inside it
* Respiratory indirect calorimetry
  * Calculates from how much much CO2 is produced for a given O2 
* Circulatory Indirect Calorimetry (CIC) or Fick Principle
  * Needs to add a needle to the subject that analyse data about the blood. 
* Doubly Labeled Water
  * Inject the participants with water.
* Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)
  * Using electrical devices to calculated the singlas to the different muscles group.
  
### Summary
Currently, there seems to be no way to estimate the EE just using the position of the headset and the controllers. It may be better to just present the total movement and also to give a heatmap to better compare and understand movement in VR. If we really want to compare for other behaviors, such as standing and siting, we might convert the movement into number of steps. However, this might underestimate the MET as it do not take into account the hand movements.
